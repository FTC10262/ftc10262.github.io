	<h3>Managers</h3>
  <p><span class="image left"><i class="fa fa-home fa-5x" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>
  Managing our teams can be a thankless job (but I promise to thank you regularly). This is
  a non-technical position. You would be at every meeting (or find a substitute). Where you
  would take attendance, help keep everyone on task, assist students individually as they 
  write their daily <i>lessons learned</i> for the engineering notebook. You would also 
  assist in handling tee-shirt and buttons for the marketing arm of your team.</p>

	<h3>Mentors</h3>
  <p><span class="image left"><i class="fa fa-wrench fa-5x" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>
  We are very fortunate to have a large group of junior mentors from the high school team.
  That said adults with technical backgrounds who are willing and able are <b>always welcome</b>.

  The primary role of a mentor on this team is to teach and to facilitate. Due to Pioneer 
  Robotic’s size and current resources, some activities must be done by Mentors. Though, 
  if time permits, our rule of thumb is – if a student can perform a task let them do it, 
  but if they can’t, then teach or train them. Some activities such as machinery operations 
  must be done by mentors or other outside source and remain the ultimate responsibility of 
  the mentor team.  Mentoring provides the opportunity to share bits and pieces of knowledge 
  and experience that each has gained through life. It also provides an excellent opportunity 
  to improve skills, learn new things, and be challenged. An excellent mentoring guide can be 
  found at the
