  Email is generally the best method for team communications. The primary email for team contact 
  is <a href='mailto:pioneer.ftc.robotics.com'>pioneer.ftc.robotics@gmail.com</a>. The team also

  of all upcoming events and activities. If you are in the group, and no longer wish to receive 
  these communications, please remove yourself at from the <a href='https://groups.google.com/'>
